# home.nix

This is my [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration.
This is how I configure my user environment on \*nix systems.
I have set it up in a modular format so that I can pick and choose which modules I want to use on a per-machine basis.

## Installation

Follow the guide in [install.md](./install.md).
