# home.nix

This is my [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configuration.
This is how I configure my user environment on \*nix systems.
I have set it up in a modular format so that I can pick and choose which modules I want to use on a per-machine basis.

## Installation

First, [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager#installation) must be installed.
After that, this command can be run to clone the repository:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:BSFishy/home.nix.git ~/.config/home-manager
```
